
Introduction
This report analyzes salaries for IT job roles in India using data covering variables such as experience, job title, education, location, age, gender, and salary. The objective is to understand which factors significantly influence salary levels and to build a predictive model.

Data Overview
The dataset contains 1000 records with key columns:

Education (High School, Bachelor, Master, PhD)

Experience (Years worked)

Location (Urban, Suburban, Rural)

Job Title (Analyst, Engineer, Manager, Director)

Age (Years)

Gender (Male, Female)

Salary (Annual salary in units)

Methodology
Data cleaning and preprocessing including dealing with missing values and categorical encoding.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to observe salary trends and group differences.

Statistical tests (ANOVA and Tukeyâ€™s HSD) to test significance of salary variance by job title.

Multiple linear regression modeling to quantify impact of factors on salary.

Key Findings
Significant salary differences exist by job title, with Directors earning the highest average salaries.

Experience positively influences salary by about 1031 units per additional year.

Location matters: Urban jobs pay more than Suburban and Rural.

Education level is a strong salary determinant: PhDs earn markedly more than others.

Gender and Age do not have statistically significant effects on salary in this dataset.

The regression model explains 87.8% of salary variation, indicating strong predictive power.

Visualizations
Boxplots of salary distribution by job title, education, and location.

Scatterplots showing relationship between salary and experience or age.

Residual analysis to verify regression assumptions.

Conclusions and Recommendations
Salary decisions should consider experience, job title, education, and location as primary factors.

Gender and age appear neutral with respect to pay equity in this data.

Further analysis could explore interaction effects and broader datasets for more insights.

Use the predictive model to estimate fair salaries for IT roles based on key characteristics.
